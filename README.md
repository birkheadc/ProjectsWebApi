# My Projects Api

A web api for storing information about the projects I am working on, mainly used to programatically display them on my homepage.

## Project Model

The `Project` model consists of all the information I need to display information about my personal software projects:

- Name
- Short and Long Descriptions -- short for a quick summary, like a sub-title; long for a full section on my 'My Projects' page
- Technologies -- a quick list of what tech was used to build it
- Site and Source -- links to the project's site / source code
