## To do!

# Build the repository

- Do something to handle errors when attempting to create a table

# Logging
- Think about how to set up email with all of my projects, so that any project can send email to my personal email address if something critical happens.

# Error handling
- A while back I attempted to build error-handling middleware but was unsuccessful. I should try again.
